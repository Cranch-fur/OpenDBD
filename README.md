# OpenDBD
An open-source project focused on reverse engineering **Dead by Daylight** to ensure its preservation and study. The repository is strictly based on game version **1.6.2**.

## 🔄 Project Status
We are actively working on the codebase. This repository will receive **periodic bulk updates** as we successfully decompile and verify new classes.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
The decompilation is currently planned in the following stages:
1.  **Core Classes [.exe/C++]** Reverse engineering of game-specific logic and classes (e.g., `\Source\DeadByDaylight\DBDGame`).
2.  **Plugins [.exe/C++]** Reverse engineering of game-specific plugins and subsystems (e.g., `\Source\OnlinePresence\`).
3.  **Project Reconstruction** Full reconstruction of the **Unreal Engine Project** files tailored for usability.
